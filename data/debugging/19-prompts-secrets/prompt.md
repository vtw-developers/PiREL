Fill in the holes in the following Python program:
```
if __ > __:
    pass
```

Strictly follow the following constraints and instructions.

Constraints regarding the holes:
1. If a hole is located inside the body of a function definition, a while loop, a for loop, or an if-else statement, ALWAYS fill it with a function invocation `secret_body_fun_4071()`.
2. If a hole is located as a condition of an if statement AND is the only token, ALWAYS fill it with a function invocation `secret_condition_fun_4071()`. If there are several holes, OR holes are part of a larger expression, DO NOT fill them with `secret_condition_fun_4071()`.

Instructions regarding output format:
1. Put each variant in a separate code block.
2. Code block should contain only the filled template.
3. Fill in the holes only. Do not add extra code.
