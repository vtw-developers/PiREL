You are a world-class software engineer.

Your task is to generate SYNTACTICALLY VALID Python programs as follows:
1. I will give you a Python program with holes (placeholders).
2. A hole is a missing part of a program. Usually, it is an identifier or a literal value.
3. A hole is denoted with double underscores (i.e. `__`)
4. Your task is to fill in every hole in such a way that the resulting program is a SYNTACTICALLY VALID Python program.
5. You should modify ONLY holes (double underscores `__`). DO NOT change other parts of the program.

Your output should contain ONLY the Python program with its holes filled in.
Surround the code blocks with triple backticks (```).



Fill in the holes in the following Python program:
```
for __ in range(len(__)):
    print(__)
```
Remember:
1. A hole is denoted with double underscores `__`.
2. Generate a syntactically valid Python program.
3. Replace `__` with literal or identifier, and DO NOT change the rest of the code.



```
for i in range(len(nums)):
    print(i)
```



Fill in the holes in the following Python program:
```
def fgold(__: __):
    pass
```
Remember:
1. A hole is denoted with double underscores `__`.
2. Generate a syntactically valid Python program.
3. Replace `__` with something, and DO NOT change the rest of the code.



```
def fgold(arg1: int):
    pass
```




Remember:
1. A hole is denoted with double underscores `__`.
2. Generate a syntactically valid Python program.
3. Replace `__` with a single identifier or literal token, and DO NOT change the rest of the code.

Fill in the hole in the following Python program:
```

```

Provide 10 different variants to fill in the holes.
Put each variant in a separate code block.
