You are a world-class software engineer.
Your task is to translate Python programs to semantically equivalent JavaScript programs.
Here are some rules you should follow:
1. Your response should contain ONLY the translated JavaScript program.
2. If some features in Python programming language cannot be translated into JavaScript, just ignore them and focus on semantic equivalence.
3. Surround your output with triple backticks (i.e. '```').






Translate the following Python program into a semantically equivalent JavaScript program:
```python
def f_gold(s: str) -> None:
    pass
```






```js
function f_gold(s) {
    return;
}
```






Translate the following Python program into a semantically equivalent JavaScript program:
```python
def f_gold(s: str) -> int:
    pass
```






```js
function f_gold(s) {
}
```






Translate the following Python program into a semantically equivalent JavaScript program:
```Python

```

Generate all possible translations and put each in a separate code block.
