    # EXPLANATION:  The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once). The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2. Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.

    # EXPLANATION:  The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1. The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2. There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2. Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.
