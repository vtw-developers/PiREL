    # EXPLANATION:   From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order. From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5. From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill. Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

    # EXPLANATION:   From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills. For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill. For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills. Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
