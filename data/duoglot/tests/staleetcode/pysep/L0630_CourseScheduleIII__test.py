    # EXPLANATION:   There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most: First, take the 1<sup>st</sup> course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100<sup>th</sup> day, and ready to take the next course on the 101<sup>st</sup> day. Second, take the 3<sup>rd</sup> course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100<sup>th</sup> day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101<sup>st</sup> day.  Third, take the 2<sup>nd</sup> course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300<sup>th</sup> day.  The 4<sup>th</sup> course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300<sup>th</sup> day, which exceeds the closed date.
