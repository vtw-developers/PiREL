    # EXPLANATION:  At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley. At index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill.  At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley. At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2. At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill. At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley.  There are 3 hills and valleys so we return 3.
