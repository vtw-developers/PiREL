    # EXPLANATION:   - Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of    value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].  - Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on    the left. stones = [-3].  The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5.

    # EXPLANATION:   - Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a    stone of value 13 on the left. stones = [13].  The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13.

    # EXPLANATION:   - Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her    score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22].  The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.
