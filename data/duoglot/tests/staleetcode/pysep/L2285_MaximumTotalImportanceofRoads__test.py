    # EXPLANATION:  The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1]. - The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6. - The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9. - The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8. - The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7. - The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7. - The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6. The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43. It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.
