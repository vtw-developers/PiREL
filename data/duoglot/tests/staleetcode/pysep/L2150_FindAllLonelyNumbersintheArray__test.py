    # EXPLANATION:   - 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums. - 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums. - 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa. Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8]. Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.

    # EXPLANATION:   - 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums. - 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums. - 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice. Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5]. Note that [5, 1] may also be returned.
