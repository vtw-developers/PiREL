    # EXPLANATION:   - We remove 1 bean from the bag with only 1 bean.   This results in the remaining bags: [4,<b><u>0</u></b>,6,5] - Then we remove 2 beans from the bag with 6 beans.   This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,<strong><u>4</u></strong>,5] - Then we remove 1 bean from the bag with 5 beans.   This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,<b><u>4</u></b>] We removed a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans. There are no other solutions that remove 4 beans or fewer.

    # EXPLANATION:  - We remove 2 beans from one of the bags with 2 beans.   This results in the remaining bags: [<u><strong>0</strong></u>,10,3,2] - Then we remove 2 beans from the other bag with 2 beans.   This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,<u><strong>0</strong></u>] - Then we remove 3 beans from the bag with 3 beans.    This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,<u><strong>0</strong></u>,0] We removed a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans. There are no other solutions that removes 7 beans or fewer.
