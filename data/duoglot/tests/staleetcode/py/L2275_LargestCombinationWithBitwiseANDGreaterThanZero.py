    # EXPLANATION:  The combination [16,17,62,24] has a bitwise AND of 16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0. The size of the combination is 4. It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than 4 has a bitwise AND greater than 0. Note that more than one combination may have the largest size. For example, the combination [62,12,24,14] has a bitwise AND of 62 & 12 & 24 & 14 = 8 > 0.

    # EXPLANATION:  The largest combination [8,8] has a bitwise AND of 8 & 8 = 8 > 0. The size of the combination is 2, so we return 2.
