    # EXPLANATION:   answer[0] = 5. Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0. The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0. answer[7] = 7. Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7. The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.
