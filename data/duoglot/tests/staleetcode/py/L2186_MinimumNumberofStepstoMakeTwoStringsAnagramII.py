    # EXPLANATION:   - In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcode<strong><u>as</u></strong>". - In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coats<u><strong>leede</strong></u>". "leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other. We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps. It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.

    # EXPLANATION:  The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.
