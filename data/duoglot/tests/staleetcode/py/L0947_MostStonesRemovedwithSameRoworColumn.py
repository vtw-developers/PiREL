    # EXPLANATION:  One way to remove 5 stones is as follows: 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1]. 2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1]. 3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0]. 4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0]. 5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0]. Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

    # EXPLANATION:  One way to make 3 moves is as follows: 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0]. 2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0]. 3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0]. Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

    # EXPLANATION:  [0,0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.
