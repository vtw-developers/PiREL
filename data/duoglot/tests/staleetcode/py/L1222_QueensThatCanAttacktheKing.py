    # EXPLANATION:     The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row.   The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column.   The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal.   The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1].   The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0].   The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.
