    # EXPLANATION:  Place 1 rock in bag 0 and 1 rock in bag 1. The number of rocks in each bag are now [2,3,4,4]. Bags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity. There are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3. It can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity. Note that there may be other ways of placing the rocks that result in an answer of 3.

There are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3. It can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity. Note that we did not use all of the additional rocks.
