    # EXPLANATION:  In the image above: -The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right. -The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right. -The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left. -The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left. The last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it falls immediately out of the plank. (i.e., We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there are no ants on the plank).
