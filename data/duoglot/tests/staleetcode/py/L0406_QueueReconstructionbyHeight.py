    # EXPLANATION:  Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front. Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front. Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1. Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1. Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3. Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1. Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
