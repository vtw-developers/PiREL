    # EXPLANATION:  One possible way to maximize your profit is to: Buy the 0<sup>th</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> stocks for a total of 5 + 2 + 3 = 10. Next year, sell all three stocks for a total of 8 + 3 + 5 = 16. The profit you made is 16 - 10 = 6. It can be shown that the maximum profit you can make is 6.
